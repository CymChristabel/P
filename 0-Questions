It seems the nondet boolean user choices matter only for "Actions", not for
deqeue or receive operations. So for computing abstract successors,
which only fire dequeue or receive, we ignore such choices.

If this is not true, I'd like to know whether the nondet choices have an
impact on which machines are enabled.

Currently the interaction of the three dimensions of nondeterminstic
choices is unclear; the implementation too complicated.
