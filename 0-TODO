German protocol:

- check the way the TestScript was constructed
- why does it not terminate with /dfs:1 (or it doesn't seem to) ?

- pretty printing of states. This is now only used for debugging purposes
  (not in comparisons or for storage), so there is no more need for a
  compressed state printing function.

- abstract execution: we now respect receive and defer sets. That is,
  not only head events can be dequeued, but also "later" events if the
  head event is not dequeable.

  Instead of duplicating the code for stepping a PrtImplMachine, I iterate
  through all events in the queue and set the environment up so that this
  event and this event only is dequeued (by putting it at the head). This
  tells me whether the event is dequeable, and it tells me what gets
  modified in the state machine other than the queue, i.e. the "local"
  variables. I uses these modifications and then only adjust the queue, to
  simulate a proper global execution step.

- made an extensible toy example, for incremental feature addition

- found out how to circumvent the recurring permission problems: during git
  commit, during git push, even during building.  We suspected at some time
  that this is due to my mixed use of Cygwin and Windows file access. So I
  used cygwin in read-only mode (for things like grep and diff). That
  helped, but sometimes the problem still recurred.

  I then noticed that starting the Developer Command Prompt for VS
  as Administrator solved all problems. Not sure that this sledge-hammer
  solution is really the way to go, but it works.
