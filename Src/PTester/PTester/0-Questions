Silly questions:

- how to "auto-indent" code? <tab> just stupidly inserts tabs
- passing by reference -- how to I prevent a variable from being modified in a function ("const")?
- int vs. ushort

Non-silly questions:

(Try:
  pt /dfs   /hash Test0.dll
  pt /dfs:3 /hash Test0.dll
)

- bounded Q semantics: I rejected sends on the /receiver/ side if the queue is full.
  Is the sender aware that the send failed? does he have to be?
