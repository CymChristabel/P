DFS on German does not terminate even with queue bound of 1.

(I build a Test Script myself; check whether it makes sense.)

========================================================================

Decide and discuss which components of a PrtImplMachine should be (i)
cloned (ii) hashed (iii) stringified. There are lots of components. E.g.
the receiveSet field does not seem to be hashed: the hash function returns

Hashing.Hash(base.GetHashCode(), eventQueue.GetHashCode());

but receiveSet it is not part of base or eventQueue.
