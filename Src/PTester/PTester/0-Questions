First show ToString method using pt /dfs:1 Test0.dll .
Output files are different, but not after sorting.

Then do "pt /dfs:2 Test0.dll" : output files are different,
even after sorting, but "wc -l" is similar to the number of
states/visible states it claims to have reached.

===========================================================================

Discuss ToString method for State and VState.

Decide and discuss which components of a PrtImplMachine should be (i)
cloned (ii) hashed (iii) ToString'ed. There are lots of components. E.g.
the receiveSet field does not seem to be hashed: the hash function returns

Hashing.Hash(base.GetHashCode(), eventQueue.GetHashCode());

but receiveSet it is not part of base or eventQueue.

========================================================================

Concrete suspicious observations we need to address:

- # of hashes of reached States and VStates is the same; shouldn't be

- # of hashes of reached VStates goes down very slightly for one step or so
    when reaching a plateau, then goes back up where it should be. Strange.

- DFS on German does not terminate even with queue bound of 1.
