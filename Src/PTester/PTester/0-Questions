Silly questions:

- how to "auto-indent" code? <tab> just stupidly inserts tabs

- passing by reference -- how to I prevent a variable from being modified in a function ("const")?

- int vs. ushort

===========================================================================

Non-silly questions:

- bounded Q semantics: I reject sends on the /receiver/ side if the queue is full.
  Is the sender aware that the send has failed? does he have to be?

- a "visible state" is currently simply the list of all queue heads.
  * I keep those in an un-hashed set. It seems I have to
  * For that I need events to be comparable. Currently this is based on (slow?) string comparison
  * how do I extract the "local state" of a machine, i.e. everything except the event queue?
