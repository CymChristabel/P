Check out German:
- is the TestScript ok?
- why does it not terminate with /dfs:1 (or it doesn't seem to) ?
- what exactle does EnabledMachine depend on: local state + queue head, if we exclude defers?
- asynchrony: can RECV and SEND actions happen simultanously?

Computing one-step successors of a bstate: I'd like to loop over all enabledMachines
and all (internal) nondet choices. What is the best way to do that? Currently
I'm mirroring the stack-based exploration, but that seems silly.

===========================================================================

Some clarification on how Execute works.

- currIndex = 0 .. enabledMachines.Count - 1 switches among enabled machines.
- choiceIndex switches among nondet choices, presumably made within the same enabled machine?

Both of these are advanced in the Execute method. In fact, choiceIndex
*only exists inside* the Execute method. currIndex also exists in the main
DFS routine, but only to detect termination, which is when currIndex =
enabledMachines.Count.
