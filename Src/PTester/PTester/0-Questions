Discuss:

1. Abstract (visible) states:

- abstract state == for each machine, queue is "tail as set". (Originally: tail as empty, but that didn't make sense.)
- to do that, changed definition of PrtEventBuffer. Does that make sense?

2. Convergence test: computing abstract successors.

3. General:

- what exactly does EnabledMachine depend on: if we exclude defers, only local state + queue head?

see deferred-set and receive-set definitions PrtBaseClasses.cs, near line 655

Note that this mechanism operates in a loop, which may dequeue multiple
messages in one step.

- asynchrony: can RECV and SEND actions happen simultaneously?

When a message is sent, it is enqueued at the receiver's side at the same time.
I doubt a message can be sent, received (enqueued) and dequeued all in one step.

4. German protocol: I need to debug it. Help:

- is the TestScript ok?
- why does it not terminate with /dfs:1 (or it doesn't seem to) ?
