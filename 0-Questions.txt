It seems the nondet Boolean user choices matter only for "Actions", not for
deqeue or receive operations. I'd like to know whether the nondet choices
have an impact on which machines are enabled.

Currently the interaction of the three dimensions of nondeterministic
choices is unclear; the implementation is too complicated.

===========================================================================

About P's facility to dequeue multiple events: this is not implementable
with either the queue SET or LIST abstraction. The reason is that P may
dequeue multiple copies of the same event, and we have no information in
the abstraction how many such copies exist.

If there is a bound on the number of dequeues /per event/, then it becomes
implementable, but it will be inefficient: P will dequeue the multiple
elements in the order they appear in the queue. We have to essentially
enumerate these orders, since the final effect may depend on it. (The LIST
order keeps the first-occurrence order intact, but after that it is again
just a permutation.)

For only 1 dequeue we just try all elements, so the cost is linear (just
like P's dequeue itself).
